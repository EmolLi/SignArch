Very well-researched and focused. The main area requiring attention was the final packaging of the concern view. The concerns/technical part is really solid.

# FEEDBACK: CONTEXT

[Full marks are for detailed, insightful, and polished context view and stakeholder descriptions that follow the best practices presented in the reference text and are generally helpful for a newcomer to understand the context of the system.]

+ Thanks for the intro in the README (watch for typos, though)
- Language is a bit rough (e.g., "following is" -> "The following are", user's -> users')
+ Good focus on main features. You don't need to go on and on about what you leave out. Maybe one short mention, that's it.
- I don't think the Context Model really shows how functionality and QAs get achieved. That would be more functional view (M2)
= The Context model is ok, but minimal. The user is not shown interacting with the system. To be more useful as a self-contained artifact, edge annotations would have been useful.
+ Context model: the level of detail is just right, in terms of element granularity.
? Dev tools. I understand about GitHub, but what's the role of Docker? I'm a bit curious here.
= Black box: the idea here was to consider your target system as a black box, i.e., not go into the details of its internals.
+ Good insights for some of the relationship edges, e.g., regarding the distribution model via WebSockets.
+ Scenarios: A very useful extra.
- Domain terminology could be explicit (expand acronyms, link to definitions, etc. e.g., NAT TURN, etc.)
- The context view could be enriched with more details about the nature/characteristics of external interfaces.
+ Stakeholder list very insightful and generally well-done. I especially liked the split between lay and concerned users, as this distinction is likely to have software architectural implications.

# FEEDBACK: CONCERNS

[Full marks are for detailed, insightful, and polished descriptions of technical concerns, decisions, and principles, supported by concrete evidence collected from the system artifacts.]

+ Overall this part is very strong, easily meets expectations. Nicely follows the structure we worked with.
- Please don't repeat the milestone instructions in your AD.
- "netto" I don't mind a few German words here and there, but other readers might be confused by this.
+ Strategy: very solid and detailed. I hope you can fulfill it!
? Concern measurability: how would we measure that?
+ Principle: one of the best examples I've seen
+ Decision: Also very good. I don't have anything major I can pick on, it's a very important and relevant decision and it's very well documented.
