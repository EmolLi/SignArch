FEEDBACK: What are the major aspects of the architectural description that can be improved?

+ Very good context, I like the requirements, context view. Maybe make the signal server more prominent?
+ I liked the positioning of the functional view.
- Key management really interesting but more part of context, maybe include with identity business, which was a bit hard to understand, and more like a tutorial on crypto. Plus, assymetric and "a symetric" sound the same. A suggestion for M2/M3 would be to package some of that crucial domain knowledge in the context view, and refer to it when needed.
+ Really liked the overlay of state diagram and GUI screenshots
+ Good way to drill down using the same layers, but label the layers in the blow-up version.
- Missing a bit of information about the streaming concern, if it's in scope.
+ Right on time;

QUESTIONS:

Q. How does streaming work? How is this represented in the functional overview?
Q> Session keys, but the app is pgp, only because clear later.
